        <h1> Welcome! </h1>
        <p> Hello! I'm Alejandro, and I'm a law graduate.</p>
        <p> I'm thinking about changing careers. In that sense, I'm programming and hosting my own webpage in my free time so, 
            besides learning how to code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I can also learn how to deal with the webhosting side. </p>

        <p> I'm currently hosting this website at home. I've got a long history on server hosting, beggining when I tried (and successfully) 
            hosted my first Minecraft server to play with my friends back in 2014. Since then, I've hosted all kinds of servers! From ftp and file sharing to media and playback servers. 
            I'm passionate about the web, the internet, connectivity and so on. 
            Surprisingly, I decided to get my bachelor's degree in a totally different area. Still, I felt that something was lacking. That's 
            why I decided to go back to the IT area in my free time, and see what happens. One might never know! </p>
        <p> Thank you for visiting! Hopefully this page will be different (prettier, sleeker, with more features) next time you visit. See ya! </p>
